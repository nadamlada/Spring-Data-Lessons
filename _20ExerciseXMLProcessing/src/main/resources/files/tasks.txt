Exercises: XML Processing
This document defines the exercise assignments for the "Spring Data" course @ SoftUni.
Product Shop Database
In the next exercises you will be required to use the models from the previous exercise for JSON processing.
1.	Seed the Database
Import the data from the provided files (users.xml, products.xml, categories.xml).
Import the users first. When importing the products, randomly select the buyer and the seller from the existing users. Leave out some products that have not been sold (i.e. buyer is null).
Randomly generate categories for each product from the existing categories.
2.	Query and Export Data
Write the below described queries and export the returned data to the specified format.
Query 1 – Products in Range
Get all products in a specified price range (e.g. 500 to 1000) which have no buyer. Order them by price (from lowest to highest). Select only the product name, the price and the full name of the seller. Export the result to XML.
products-in-range.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<products>
  <product name="TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE" price="516.46" seller="Christine Gomez" />
  <product name="Allopurinol" price="518.50" seller="Kathy Gilbert" />
  <product name="Parsley" price="519.06" seller="Jacqueline Perez" />
  ...
</products>
Query 2 – Successfully Sold Products
Get all users, who have at least 1 item sold with a buyer. Order them by last name, then by first name. Select the person's first and last name. For each of the products sold (products with buyers), select the product's name, price and the buyer's first and last name.

<users>
  <user first-name="Carl" last-name="Daniels">

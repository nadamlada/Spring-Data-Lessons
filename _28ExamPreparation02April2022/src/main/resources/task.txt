Spring Data Exam – 02 April 2022
Real Estate Agency

Find the best home, investment or commercial property or speak to our estate agents today. Here you will find a large selection of the best apartments, houses or garages and of course, they will all be at best prices. To offer a better experience to its customers, the agency urgently needs a good enough application that collects all the information about all available estates and can, with one click, dig through the sorted best offers. The real estate agency owner has turned to SoftUni for help. Now a small team led by you must take on this task.
1.	Functionality Overview
The application should be able to easily import hard-formatted data and support functionalities for also exporting the imported data. The application is called – Real Estate Agency.
Look at the pictures below to see what must happen:

•	The home page before importing anything:
•	The import JSON page before importing anything:
•	Import the towns first:
•	Import the agents second:
•	The import JSON page after importing both files:
•	The import XML page before importing the given data:
•	Import the apartments data:
•	Import the offers data:
•	The import XML page after importing the data:
•	The home page after the data is imported:
•	Export offers for three_rooms apartments:

2.	Project Skeleton Overview
You will be given a skeleton, containing a certain architecture (MVC) with several classes, some of which are completely empty. The Skeleton will include the files with which you will seed the database.
3.	Model Definition
There are 4 main models that the Real Estate Agency database application should contain in its functionality.
Design them in the most appropriate way, considering the following data constraints:
Town
•	id – accepts integer values, a primary identification field, an auto incremented field.
•	town name – accepts char sequences as values where their character length value is higher than or equal to 2. The values are unique in the database.
•	population – accepts number values (must be positive), 0 as a value is exclusive.
Agent
•	id – accepts integer values, a primary identification field, an auto incremented field.
•	first name – accepts char sequences as values where their character length value higher than or equal to 2. The values are unique in the database.
•	last name – accepts char sequences as values where their character length value higher than or equal to 2.
•	email – an email – (must contains ‘@’ and ‘.’ – dot). The email of a seller is unique.
•	Constraint: The agents table has а relation with the towns table.

Apartment
•	id – accepts integer values, a primary identification field, an auto incremented field.
•	apartment type – the enumeration, one of the following – two_rooms, three_rooms, four_rooms
•	area – accepts number values that are more than or equal to 40.00.
•	Constraint: The apartment table has а relation with the towns table.

Offer
•	id – accepts integer values, a primary identification field, an auto incremented field.
•	price – accepts a positive number.
•	published on – a date in the "dd/MM/yyyy" format.
•	Constraint: The offers table has a relation with the apartments table.
•	Constraint: The offers table has a relation with the agents table.

Relationships
Your partners gave you a little hint about the more complex relationships in the database, so that you can implement it correctly.
One Agent may have only one Town, but one Town may have many Agents.
One Apartment may have only one Town, but one Town may have many Apartments.
One Offer may have only one Apartment, but one Apartment can be in many Offers.
One Offer may have only one Agent, but one Agent can have many Offers.

Constraint:
•	Name the entities and their class members exactly in the format stated above.
•	All fields are NOT NULL unless explicitly stated to be nullable.

4.	Data Import
Use the provided files to populate the database with data. Import all the information from those files into the database.
You are not allowed to modify the provided files.
ANY INCORRECT data should be ignored and a message:
 "Invalid {town / agent / apartment / offer}" should be printed.
When the import is finished:
"Successfully imported {town / agent / apartment / offer} {name - population / first name last name / type – area / price}"


JSON Import
Your new colleagues have prepared some JSON data for you to import.

5.	Data Export

Get ready to export the data you have imported in the previous task. Here you will have some complex database querying. Export the data in the formats specified below.

Export The Best Offers from the Data Base

•	Extract from the database, the agent full name, offer’s id, apartment area (to second digit after decimal point), town name of the apartment and the price (to second digit after decimal point) of the offer.
•	Filter only three_rooms apartments and order them by the area in descending order, then by the price in ascending order.
•	Return the information in this format:
•	"Agent {firstName} {lastName} with offer №{offerId}:
   		-Apartment area: {area}
   		--Town: {townName}
   		---Price: {price}$
. . . "
